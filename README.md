Advisory
---


Advisory is a messaging recommendation platform for optimizing signature request gathering via email.

## Inspiration

Creating the signature request is only one part of the effort when using Dropbox/Hellosign.

The second half is actually collecting the signature, and this can often be greatly influenced by the messaging that goes along with the request.


## What it does

Advisory takes the challenge out of crafting the perfect signature request email by fusing the context of the signature request with generative AI to give you an email draft to send to the signer.

### How to run
`yarn; yarn dev`

    

From `./server`

Set the following `.env` variables:
<pre>
    DROPBOX_KEY= // your key for sign api
    DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID= // your dropbox app client id
    OPENAI_KEY= // your open ai api key
</pre>

`yarn; yarn start`
